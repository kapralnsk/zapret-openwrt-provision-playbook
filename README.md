# zapret provisioning for OpenWrt

Provisions an OpenWrt router with [zapret](https://github.com/bol-van/zapret). Generated by [Cursor](https://cursor.sh)

**NOTE that this is heavily WIP: not tested at all yet and as such likely to fail. Use at own risk.**

Includes:

- Ansible Playbook with zapret provisioning logic
- PowerShell script to run the playbook in Docker
- PowerShell script compiled from the Playbook to run as native as possible on Windows
